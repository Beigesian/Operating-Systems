One function of an operating system is process management. It is a core concept and major function of all operating systems. An operating system assigns the processor to processes and deallocates the processor when it is no longer needed for such tasks.
Another function of an operating system is file management. This is the ability for an operating system to allocate and deallocate resources to processes and for a certain duration. The Operating system is responsible for organizing and tracking the files as well as directories, where they are saved, when they are saved, when they are retrieved. It is also responsible for extending a way to create files and directories, finding, copying, renaming and deleting these items as well.
An Operating System is in charge of how memory is managed in the environment. It is tasked with making a decision of providing a duration and allocation of amount of memory charged to a particular process or processes. The OS determines the amount of memory required for the process instruction and data and then loads that into RAM. When the process is finished the allocated space is cleared and is free to be allocated for another process.
